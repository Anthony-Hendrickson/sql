All of my previous data analyst work has been done at law firms and I think there is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed; Diversity and Inclusion data is incomplete.

Law firms are basically broken down into two groups; business services/law clerks and lawyers. It is in the interest of the business 
owners (lawyers) to highlight the diversity of their staff. However there isn't an incentive for the business services/law clerks to 
volunteer this info and this group also tends to be where the diversity is in law firms. In my opinion this is a very patroninzing dynmic 
as well, which doesn't help diversity information volunteerism.

A simple pattern is playing out as in the rest of society: people do what is in their best interest. Lawyers win RFPs and meet increasing 
DEI standards and scrutiny from clients by having diversity in their organization and leveraging the data reflecting it. 

Business services/law clerks are of course kept employed by business won and acquired by lawyers but aren't receiving compensation winfalls 
as lawyers do and they don't.

I think three incentives to volunteer this data could be:

1. Look at diversity per $100k wages as well as headcounts.
2. Pay staff for the use of their data in revenue generating activities as a royalty.
3. Let staff see the data.

Maybe if I was a business leader I would be inclined to say "this isn't good for the bottom line!" but I'm not so I have the freedom to say
I think this would be worthwhile.
